# Hi there

I'm Daenney and I work on open source things that I find interesting. Most of
my contributions on GitHub nowadays are unrelated to my job.

## ðŸ”­ Maintainer

I'm an active maintainer for the following projects:
* [GoToSocial](https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial): an ActivityPub server written in Go
* [DTLS](https://github.com/pion/dtls/): a DTLS (TLS for UDP) implementation in pure Go
* [Flask-Dance](https://github.com/singingwolfboy/flask-dance): an oauth2 plugin for Flask

In the past I've also been the maintainer of a lot of things in the
configuration management space, specifically related to Puppet and
as a founder of the Vox Pupuli organisation:
* [Puppetboard](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard) and [PyPuppetDB](https://github.com/voxpupuli/pypuppetdb)
* [puppetlabs-apt](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apt)

## ðŸ’¬ Assorted projects and contributions

captured my attention:
